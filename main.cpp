Project 3 - Part 1 / 5
Video:  Chapter 2 Part 5
User-Defined Types

Create a branch named Part1

Purpose: The entire purpose of this 5-part project is to get you writing C++ code that compiles and to reinforce the syntax habits that C++ requires.  What you create in this project will be used as the basis of Project 5 in the course.   

1) write 10 user-defined types in plain english
   - This step will involve several checkpoints before it is complete.

Checkpoint 1:
    Fill in #1 - 4 with a random UDT in plain english
    These 4 UDTs do not need to be related.
    For each plain-english UDT, write out 3 things it can do, and 5 traits or properties.

************************
    Commit after you complete this step so i can review before you proceed
    Ping me in Slack to review this step.
    Wait for me to review before proceeding to the next Checkpoint
************************

Checkpoint 2:
    For the 10th UDT, come up with an object that is made of 5 smaller parts.
    Here is an example:
    Cell Phone

    A Cell Phone is made up of the following 5 properties:
        Display
        Memory
        CPU
        Radio
        Applications

    A Cell Phone has 3 things it can do:
        make a call
        send a text
        run an application.

************************

Checkpoint 3: 

    Fill in #5 - #9 with plain-english UDTs for the 5 properties you created for UDT #10

    The goal of this step is to get you to think about breaking down an object into smaller and smaller objects, until the smallest object is made of up only C++ primitives. 

    These 5 things can be broken down into their own sub-objects and properties. 

    For example: Display
    A Display has the following 5 traits or properties:
        pixels
        amount of power consumed.
        brightness.
        width
        height

    the Display's brightness can be represented with a Primitive, such as a double. 
    The amount of power consumed can also be represented with a Primitive.
    The 'pixels' must be represented with an array of Pixel instances.  Arrays have not been discussed and can't be used in this project.
    Instead, we can use an Integer primitive to describe the Number of Pixels:

    Display:
        Number of Pixels
        Amount of Power consumed
        Brightness

    Notice that I did not write "has a display" or "Has memory" or "has a cpu"  
    Writing 'has a ___" checks whether or not your object *has the ability to do something*.
    Instead, I wrote "Display" or "CPU".  These are specific objects or amounts. 
    In C++ terms, this means to I want you to avoid bool (has a) as a member variable type.
    Instead, prefer the other primitive types when you get to step 2)

 2) define your struct for each of your 10 types. 
    - Copy your 3 actions & 5 traits into your struct body.
    - comment them out.
    - I recommend compiling after finishing each one and making sure it compiles without errors or warnings before moving on to writing the next UDT.
 
 3) declare your member variables and member functions underneath each plain-english comment in your struct's body.
    - give the member variables relevant data types
 
 4) make the function parameter list for those member functions use some of your User-Defined Types
    - You'll write definitions in part2 for these functions
    - you'll call each of these functions in part3
 
 5) make 2 of the 10 user-defined types have a nested class.  
    - this nested class also needs at least 2 member functions.
    - these nested classes are not considered one of your 10 UDTs.
 
 6) your 10th UDTs should only use 5 of your other UDTs for its member variable types.   
    - No primitives allowed!
 
 7) After you finish defining each type, click the [run] button.  Clear up any errors or warnings as best you can.
 
 Commit your changes by clicking on the Source Control panel on the left, entering a message, and click [Commit and push].
 
 Make a pull request after you make your first commit and pin the pull request link to our DM thread.

send me a DM to check your pull request

 Wait for my code review.
